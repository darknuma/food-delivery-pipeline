Write Tests (Unit/Integration)
Critical to ensure reliability of your existing components
Should cover:
1. Event generator logic (completed)
2. Kafka producer/consumer functions (completed)
3. S3 operations 
4. Snowflake transformations
5. Metric calculations


Write Validation Tests
1. Data quality checks
2. Schema validation
3. Business rule validation
4. End-to-end data flow validation

Create Orchestrator with Prefect
_____________________________________________
1. Workflow orchestration for your ETL pipeline
2. Task dependencies and scheduling
3. Error handling and retries
4. Monitoring and logging
______________________________________________

Kubernetes Setup
1.Set up local development with minikube/kind
Create deployments for:
1. Kafka
2. Event generator
3. Consumers
4. Prefect workflows


Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
1. AWS resources (S3, IAM)
2. Snowflake resources
3. Kubernetes infrastructure
4. Network configuration


CI/CD Pipeline
1.Test automation : In our template, we have defined formatting (isort, black), type checking (mypy), lint/Style checking (flake8), & python testing (pytest) as part of our ci .
2. Build processes
3. Deployment automation
4. Environment management

Power BI Visualization
1. Connect to Snowflake
2. Create dashboards for metrics
3. Set up refreshes
4. User access management



This order prioritizes:
* Testing (ensures reliability)
* Orchestration (manages workflow)
* Infrastructure (deployment environment)
* Automation (CI/CD)
* Visualization (end-user interface)
